I used to design circuits and improve semiconductor manufacturing technologies.

In 2012 I was the technical coordinator at [Marginalia+Lab](https://vimeo.com/marginalialab), an art and technology residency space in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

More recently, I worked as a design-engineer at [BeatBots](http://www.beatbots.net/) in San Francisco, where we prototyped interactive robotic toys, and other things.

In 2015, as a Researcher in Residence at FACT in Liverpool, I helped start and run [FACTLab](http://alab.space/) and the [Reading & Thinging](http://olf.space) study group.

Iâ€™m also part of [Astrovandalistas](http://www.astrovandalistas.cc/base/), an art+technology+activism collective based in Mexico City.
