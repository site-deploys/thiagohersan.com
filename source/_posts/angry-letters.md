Just because they shouldn't be read, doesn't mean they can't be written!

A simple ritual for sharing angry messages with the world:

1. Write mean and angry letters.
2. Offset their words so they fit in one page, even if their letters overlap.
3. Set the font color to something light or transparent.
4. Print them over and over on the same piece of paper.
5. Cut them into individual letters.
6. Add return address (optional).
7. Send, burn, burry or eat the letters.
