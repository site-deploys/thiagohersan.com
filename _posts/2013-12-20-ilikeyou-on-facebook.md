Anyone who understands big data will agree that: 

<div class="inline-image-container" markdown="1">
  ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) + ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) + ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) + ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) + ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) = ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/heart.png)
</div>

<div class="inline-image-container" markdown="1">
  [iLikeYou (on facebook)](http://app.thiagohersan.com/iLikeYou/) is a web app designed to help us quantify our feelings towards each other. It  goes through facebook data and tries to ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) every post, picture and comment published by, or tagged with, a chosen friend.
</div>

<div class="inline-image-container" markdown="1">
  Much like real love, the amount of data you can actually ![](/images/projects/ilikeyou-on-facebook/like.png) using this app is determined by the other person's privacy settings and how much they trust you.
</div>

This project is part of an ongoing [series](/project/ilikeme-on-facebook/ ) of web [applications](/project/ulikeme-on-facebook/) meant to explore different aspects of our technology-mediated interactions.
